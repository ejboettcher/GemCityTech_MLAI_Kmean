## Unsupervised Learning 

Before we get into k-means.  Let's go over unsupervised learning.
Unsupervised learning is when you have data but do not have the truth but need to classify.

<br>

Supervised learning is when you have labels for each data point.

<br>
<br>

### Example of Data for Supervised Learning is 

| Data                     | Truth / Label | Data                                 |  Truth  /Label  |
|:-------------------------|:--------------|:-------------------------------------|:--------------|
| ![](./img/cat_test2.jpg){width="200px"} | cat           | ![](./img/smores.jpg){width="200px"} | dog           |

### Example of data for unsupervised learning

Same data as above but without the Truth / Label




| Data                     | Data                                   |
|:-------------------------|:--------------|
| ![](./img/cat_test2.jpg){width="200px"} | ![](./img/smores.jpg){width="200px"} | 

<br>

### Goal of unsupervised learning

Find features that separate the data into groups / clusters.
Then hope there is a small number of labeled features so that we can classify those groups.

### Why Do Unsupervised

Labeled data is really expensive.

## Gedunken Experiment

Say there is a town with two employers (A and B).  
Predict if person works for A or B, based on where they live.

<br>

First stab: See if people are clustered around their work place.

So if we had a clustering algorithm we can predict where a person might work.

### K-Means

K-means is the most common clustering algorithm.
<br>
K-means clusters, n data points (e.g. All your data) into k clusters by placing each data point to the nearest k.

<br>

Example: point **p** is 5 ft from $k_i$ and 10 feet from $k_j$.  K-means would then place point **p** into the
$k_i$ group.  Once, all the points are placed into a cluster or group, the new means for each cluster ($k_i$ and $k_j$) 
are updated.  The location for each mean cluster __k__ is calculated by finding the mean from all the points that belong to that cluster.

<br>


* Seed with initial k mean points
* Find where each point belongs: cluster A or B
* Calculate a new mean for A and B
* Repeat steps 2 and 3.

### Kmeans

Kmeans is just that, k means.

---

### Background 

k-means clustering comes from signal processing.  Invented in 1967 by MacQueen.<br>
k-means clustering minimizes within-cluster
variances (squared Euclidean distances).  There is also k-medians and k-medoids.

<br>

K-means is an iterative method. (We repeated steps 2 and 3, till some threshold)

<br>

It converges but it can converge to a local minium!<br>
k-means and Gaussian mixture model both use cluster centers to model the data.

<br>

k-means clustering assumes each mean has same distribution, while the Gaussian mixture model 
allows clusters to have different distributions.

---

### K-means math

Randomly create an initial set of k means: $\mu_1$, ..., $\mu_k$.

Alternating between assignment and update steps:

<br>

#### Assignment step: 

Assign each data point to the cluster
with the nearest mean (least squared Euclidean distance).

Each point is assigned to exactly **one** k mean.  Creating k sets ($S$)

$$
S_i = { x_p: | x_p - \mu_i |^2 <= | x_p - \mu_j |^2 \forall_j, 1 \leq j \leq k } 
$$

#### Update step: 

Recalculate the means (centroids) from the datapoints with in each set S.

$$
\mu_i = 1/ S_i \sum_p x_p
$$

* Predicted Centers: [[-0.27   0.46], [ 5.73,  2.83]]
* True Centers:  (1, 1), (6, 3)

## Gaussian Mixture Model

K-means assumes that the K number of guassians have the same variance (e.g. width)
Gaussian Mixture Model does not assume that.

<br>

### Much Nicer

## What is Gaussian Mixture Model.

:::{.columns}
::::{.column width=68%}

Basically, GMM is a generalized k-means clustering algorithm which
incorporates information about the covariance structure of the data as well as the centers of the 
 latent Gaussians (scikit-learn).
 
A Gaussian mixture model is a probabilistic model that assumes all the 
data points are generated from a mixture of a finite number of Gaussian 
distributions with unknown parameters.

::::
:::

Each Gaussian k belongs to a set of clusters where k ∈ {1,…, K}, where K is the number of 
clusters of our dataset. Each k in the mixture comprises the following parameters:

* A mean $\mu$ that defines its center.
* A covariance $\Sigma$ that defines its width. This would be equivalent to the dimensions of an ellipsoid in a multivariate scenario.
* A mixing probability $\pi$ that defines how big or small the Gaussian function will be.


---

![Toward Data Science](./img/1_lTv7e4Cdlp738X_WFZyZHA.png)

In addition, the mixing coefficients/probabilities $\pi$  must sum to 1.  
E.g. Each data point must exist in one of the k gaussian.

$$
\sum_{k=1}^{K} \pi_k = 1 
$$


---

In practice, people use a kmeans to determine the initial seeding for the GMM. 
GMM is slower / computationally intensive than kmean.


<br>
<br>

```python
# Get Data
A_points, B_points, mu_A, mu_B = define_points()
points = np.concatenate((A_points, B_points), axis=0)

# Kmeans
kmeans = KMeans(init="random", n_clusters=2, n_init=10, max_iter=1000, random_state=42)
kmeans.fit(points)
# kmeans_plot(points, kmeans)

# GMM
gmm = GMM(n_components=2, random_state=0)
gmm.fit(points)
gmm_labels = gmm.predict(points)
gmm_plot(points, kmeans, gmm_labels)

```

<br>

### Who uses GMM 

GMM is used for 

* recommendations (e.g. which movie you will like)
* correcting for [air turbulence](https://ecommons.udayton.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1426&context=ece_fac_pub) in imagery
* We saw in October Modeling Nano Tube production

## Thank you

Though my code was only two lines, implementing GMM or K-means can be harder

<br>

Remember: The difference between practice and theory is that it is smaller in theory!
