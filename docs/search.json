    "text": "What is Gaussian Mixture Model.\n\n\nBasically, GMM is a generalized k-means clustering algorithm which incorporates information about the covariance structure of the data as well as the centers of the latent Gaussians (scikit-learn).\nA Gaussian mixture model is a probabilistic model that assumes all the data points are generated from a mixture of a finite number of Gaussian distributions with unknown parameters.\n\n code\n\n\nEach Gaussian k belongs to a set of clusters where k ∈ {1,…, K}, where K is the number of clusters of our dataset. Each k in the mixture comprises the following parameters:\n\nA mean \\(\\mu\\) that defines its center.\nA covariance \\(\\Sigma\\) that defines its width. This would be equivalent to the dimensions of an ellipsoid in a multivariate scenario.\nA mixing probability \\(\\pi\\) that defines how big or small the Gaussian function will be."
